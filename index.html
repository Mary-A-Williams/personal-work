    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <P>Welcome! Sit tight, Grab a popcorn and enjoy this page.</P>
    <p>
        My name is Mary Williams and I'm a Customer Service Representative that is transitioning into <b>TECH!</b> I'm a graduate of Biology Education at Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State.
    Graduated in the year 2019. Went on to serve my country in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in the year 2020. During my service, I worked as a Teacher because of my field of study but i must say I really didn't enjoy teaching.
Do I hate Teaching? No! I don't just do well in it. I'm a very shy person.
</p>
<p>
After my service year, I got a job as a sales representative at a company called <b>EASYBUY.</b>
Did the job for a while and i must say I really enjoyed it. Although it was stressful but I enjoyed it.
After 3 months of working with <b>EASYBUY</b>, I got a referral from a friend about a job at <b>CHOICE CTD LOGISTICS</b>
</p>
<p>
    I started working with <b>CHOICE CTD LOGISTICS</b> in the year 2021 and I must say I really enjoyed working with them. I was a Customer Service Representative and I must say I really enjoyed the job.
    My job was to attend to customers complaints and inquiries. At first it was really easy but as time went on it became really stressful.
    At some point i got tired of the job and I wanted to quit but i couldn't because i needed the money to survive.
</p>
<p>
    You might be wondering, "Why would I want to quit?" Well, let say it like this, You know when you apply for a particular job and you know what your job description is but you start getting told to do things that are not part of your job description. Yep! That was what I was going through.
But along the line it got better. That didn't stop me from job hunting and upskilling myself.
Took a course on <b>VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE</b> at <b>ALX AFRICA</b>. It was a starting point for me to start my journey into tech.
<br>One thing you should know about me is that I'm a very curious person. I love to learn new things and I'm always ready to learn.
Although it wasn't easy combining it with my 9-5 job but I was able to pull through.
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I got a job as a Communications Specialist at <b>FAITH MATCH</b>. Yes! you guessed right, it is a match making platform for Christians who are wanting to find love.
    I enjoy the job because it's flexible(Remote).
</p>
<p>
    I've always wanted to dive into the real tech world and I'm so glad I was given a scholarship at <b>ALT SCHOOL AFRICA</b> to study <b>FRONTEND ENGINEERING</b>
It has been good so far, but these few days, I've been struggling with my Assignment which i was able to figure out after so many sleepness nights and tutorial videos.
